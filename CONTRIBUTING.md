# 🧪 Contributing to In A Bubble Lab
Thank you for your interest in joining the Bubble Lab! 🫧 
Here’s how you can help keep our experiments running smoothly and safely.


## How to Contribute
1. **Fork the Lab Repository** – Create your own copy of the lab to tinker safely.
2. **Create a Branch** – Start a new experiment branch for your feature or bugfix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b experiment/my-new-feature
3. **Make Your Changes** – Code, test, and document your changes carefully. Treat the lab like a real experiment: measure, test, and observe.
4. **Push Your Branch** – Send your branch back to your fork:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b experiment/my-new-feature
5. **Open a Pull Request** – Submit your PR to the main Bubble Lab repository.
Clearly explain:
* What your change does
* Why is it needed
* Any special instructions to test it

## Lab Etiquette
* Keep the lab safe and respectful—no “bubble bursts” (rude comments, harassment, or disruptive behaviour).
* Review and test before submitting your PR—clean experiments lead to reliable results.
* Be responsive to feedback from supervisors and fellow researchers.

## Reporting Bugs & Suggestions
* Use GitHub Issues to report any bugs, propose new experiments, or share ideas.
* Label issues clearly (bug, enhancement, question) to help the lab crew track them efficiently.

## Thank You!
Your contributions help keep the lab lively, accurate, and fun! Every PR, bug report, or new experiment makes our Bubble Lab better. 🫧
