# 🫧 In A Bubble Lab
## 📜🎉 Phase 5: Presenting The Final Analysis (Interview)
**Goal:** Transform the lab into a polished, interactive environment 
— complete with performance visualization, experiment tracking, and aesthetic enhancements.

## 📊 Features
### Visual Control Panel 2.0 (GUI Overhaul)
Make your control panel feel like a real research dashboard:
- 🧭 Sleek, minimal design (soft gradients or lab glass-like panels).
- 📈 Add a chart or progress bar that shows experiment speed comparisons.
- 🪄 Include animated text or icons (like bubbling or glowing buttons).
- 🧪 Replace static text area with a tabbed interface (Dataset | Experiment Log | Results Graph).
**Bonus idea:** Use JTabbedPane, JProgressBar, and JTable to make it look like a live lab console.

### Results Logging and Exporting
Let the lab record every experiment run:
- Store experiment results (dataset name, algorithm, structure, time).
- Display results in a table.
- Add Export Results → CSV/TXT button.

### Performance Graphs (Live Visualization)
Use JFreeChart or a simple Swing-based chart to:
- Compare algorithm times.
- Display a “Leaderboard” of which structure performed best.
**Or simpler:** use Graphics2D to draw colorful bars per algorithm.

### Lab Sound & Aesthetic Vibe (Optional Fun!)
Add playful immersion:
- Sound when experiment finishes.
- Subtle bubble animation in background (custom JPanel with draw cycles).
- Light/Dark theme toggle.

### Documentation & Final Polish
- Write a full README.md (Project Overview + Phases 1–5).
- Add credits, version history, and dataset examples.
- Include a “lab manual” section for users.

## How To Run
1. Open the project in your IDE.
2. Execute final analysis scripts or GUI summary mode.
3. Review results and performance logs for all experiments.

## Notes
- Phase 5 focuses on analysis, reporting, and lab conclusion.
- Can export results for documentation or presentation.
