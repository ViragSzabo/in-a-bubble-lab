# ðŸ«§ In A Bubble Lab
## ðŸ§¬ðŸ“Š Phase 4: Inviting The Test Subjects (Datasets)
**Goal:** Apply datasets to all lab teams and run performance experiments.

## ðŸ“Š Features
- **Dataset Management:** Load, convert, and shuffle datasets.
- **Experiment Execution:** Apply sorting and searching algorithms on Queue, Stack, and Set.
- **Performance Comparison:** Measure execution times and efficiency.
- **Test Subjects:** Handles different data types â€” integers, strings, doubles, and mixed datasets.

## How To Run
1. Open the project in your IDE.
2. Use the GUI to import datasets.
3. Assign datasets to teams and execute strategies.
4. Observe console or GUI output for performance stats.

## Notes
- Ensures datasets are rebuilt before each experiment.
- Supports reproducible performance comparisons.
- Phase 4 focuses on full-lab testing with real datasets.
