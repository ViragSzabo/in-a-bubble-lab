# 🫧 In A Bubble Lab
## 🧱⚙️ Phase 1: Building The Teams (Data Structures)
**Goal:** Implement custom data structures ready for lab experiments.

## 📊 Data Structures: The Teams
- **Queue (FlowMaster)**  
  FIFO structure. Methods: `enqueue`, `dequeue`, `peek`, `isEmpty`, `size`.
- **Stack (PileDriver)**  
  LIFO structure. Methods: `push`, `pop`, `peek`, `isEmpty`.
- **Set (UniqueVault)**  
  Ensures uniqueness and fast lookup. Methods: `add`, `remove`, `contains`.

## 📜 Notes
- Tested with integers, strings, and doubles.
- Provides helper methods for peek, size, and conversion to list.
- All structures are generic and support mutual comparisons.

## ⚙️ How To Run Tests
1. Open the project in your IDE.
2. Run `FlowMasterTest`, `PileDriverTest`, and `UniqueVaultTest` to verify functionality.
