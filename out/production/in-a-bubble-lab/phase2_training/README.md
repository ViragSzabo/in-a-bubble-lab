# 🫧 In A Bubble Lab
## 🧹🐾 Phase 2: Training The Strategies (Algorithms)
**Goal:** Implement sorting and searching algorithms for the lab teams.

## 📊 Algorithms
### Sorting: The Clean-Up Crew
- **Bubble:** Classic sorting method (O(n²)).
- **Smart Bubble:** Optimised Bubble that stops early if data is already sorted.

### Searching: The Trackers
- **Sequential Search (LabScanner):** Methodical scan, works on unsorted data.
- **Optimised Sequential (LabSniper):** Faster, precise scanning.

## Tests & Performance
- Compare cleaning performance: `SoapySquad` vs `FoamMaster`.
- Compare searching performance: `LabScanner` vs `LabSniper`.
- Tested on all data structures: Queue, Stack, Set.

## How To Run Tests
1. Open the project in your IDE.
2. Run `CleaningTeamTest` and `ResearcherTeamTest`.
3. Observe console output for execution times of each strategy.

## Notes
- Use helper methods to rebuild data structures before each performance test.
- All algorithms are generic and can handle different data types.
