# 🫧 In A Bubble Lab
## 🎛️🖥️ Phase 3: Equipping The Lab (GUI)
**Goal:** Implement a control panel GUI to manage datasets, assign them to teams, and run algorithms.

## 📊 Features
- **Import:** Load datasets into the lab.
- **Convert:** Assign datasets to Queue, Stack, or HashSet.
- **Execute:** Run sorting (Bubble, Smart Bubble) and searching (Sequential, Optimised Sequential) strategies.
- **Performance Tracking:** Observe execution times for each team and algorithm.
- **Supervisor Mode:** Visualise and control the experiment like a lab supervisor.

## How To Run
1. Open the project in your IDE.
2. Run the GUI main class (e.g., `LabControlPanel`).
3. Use import, conversion, and execution buttons to interact with datasets.
4. Observe execution times and results in the GUI panel.

## Notes
- GUI uses Swing/JavaFX.
- Designed to work with datasets of varying sizes and types.
- Phase 3 is mostly about visualization and controlling experiments.
