# ðŸ§ª In A Bubble Lab â€“ Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as members, contributors, and leaders, pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Lab Standards

Positive lab behaviour includes:
* Showing empathy and kindness toward fellow researchers
* Respecting differing opinions, approaches, and hypotheses
* Giving and accepting constructive feedback gracefully
* Learning from mistakes and improving lab practices
* Focusing on what is best for the lab and its community, not just individual experiments

Unacceptable lab behaviour includes:
* Using offensive, sexualized, or harassing language or imagery
* Trolling, insulting, or targeting other contributors
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing othersâ€™ private information without permission
* Any behaviour that would be considered unsafe or unprofessional in a lab

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Lab supervisors are responsible for clarifying and enforcing these standards.
They may take appropriate corrective action for behaviour deemed unsafe, unprofessional, or disruptive.
Supervisors may **edit**, **remove**, or **reject contributions** _(code, issues, wiki edits, or comments)_
that violate this Code of Conduct and will communicate reasons when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all lab spacesâ€”online or offlineâ€”and 
when someone represents the lab officially _(e.g., social media, email, presentations, events)_.

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter any inappropriate behaviour, 
please report it to the lab supervisor at szabo.viragnak@gmail.com or virag.szabo@student.nhlstenden.com.
All reports will be reviewed promptly and handled with care for the privacy of everyone involved.

## Consequences

Lab supervisors may apply the following corrective measures, depending on severity:
1. **Correction** â€“ Private warning with explanation, possible public apology if needed.
2. **Warning** â€“ Official notice of violation with temporary restrictions in lab spaces.
3. **Temporary Ban** â€“ Removal from lab spaces for a specified time; no interaction with involved parties.
4. **Permanent Ban** â€“ Permanent removal from all lab activities for repeated or severe violations.
